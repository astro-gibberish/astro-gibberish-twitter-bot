# astro-gibberish twitter bot

## About

I made this primarily for my own entertainment, inspired by things like [shitty.news](http://shitty.news) and [subreddit simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/). It pulls some tid-bits about astronomy, technology, and other nerdy things from a few APIs including:

  * astrocast -- a collection of astronomy facts
  * wired.com -- technology news
  * fortrabbits quotes -- a json file of quotes on github

## To build 
To use the astronomy gibberish script and get some entertaining markov-chain generated sentences:

```
git clone https://github.com/astro-gibberish/astro-gibberish-twitter-bot.git
cd astro-gibberish-twitter-bot
gem install bundler
bundle install
./astro gibberish
```
